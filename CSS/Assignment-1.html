        <p>The dog<strong> (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</strong>  is a
            domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
            it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern
            wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.Dogs were the first
            species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over<strong> 15,000</strong> years
            ago before the development of agriculture.Due to their long
            association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number
            of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a
            starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
